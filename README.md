# Sakila Oy -project
> Welcome to showcase of one of my projects called ***"Sakila Oy"***. It was a school project, with the help of which I had to show the skills of working with a ready-made *MySQL* database, which consisted of multiple tables and information, and from them I had to display the desired one on the client side. *Node.js* technology and its *Express.js* component helped me to implement all this. The pages were built using the built-in *Express* component - *EJS*, which allows you to create page models and use *JavaScript* directly in those. Well, let's move on to the project itself!

> On the **main page**, you can see the standard text *Lorem ipsum*, with the help of which I created a kind of "greeting", since we were simply not given any other text. In the navigation bar, the very first element called *"Kotisivulle"* takes us back to the main page, *"Kaikki Elokuvat"* directs us to the page with all the films that the fictitious company rents, but more on that later, followed by *"MikÃ¤ on Sakila?"* directing to a page with information about the company, and the last *"Haku"* to a page with a search bar. In my next school project, the search technology was transferred from a separate page straight to the navigation bar.

> A little further down on the same main page are two movie categories, *"Action"* and *"Horror"*, each with five movies with information about *title, price, category, age rating, and length*. At the end of each category there is a button that redirects the user to a page with *all the films in that category.*

> Everything is simple on this page. Here you can find *the entire range of films* available for rent by ***Sakila***, all with the same information as in the categories on the main page. Of the minuses of this page, its too long and the has no pagination, which, by the way, was corrected in the next school project.

> Page with information about the company. The same *Lorem ipsum* was used in the absence of any other text. Nothing special.

> Separate page with a search bar. The search takes place by the ***exact title of the requested film***, that is, ***the title must be written in full and without typos.*** Otherwise, it will throw **an error**. If **successful**, it gives information of the film's *title, price, category, age rating and length.*

> This completes the showcase of my school project ***"Sakila Oy"***. Thank you for your attention. You can also take a look at my second school project, in which I worked already in the team and the mistakes made here were corrected there.
